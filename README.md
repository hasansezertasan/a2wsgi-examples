# a2wsgi Examples

The purpose of this project is to provide examples of how we can use (integrate) different Python Web Frameworks together using [a2wsgi][a2wsgi].

## Why

Who likes migration? But in some cases, it's necessary. [a2wsgi] helps us to convert our ASGI applications to WSGI or vice versa.

A Scenerio (that I have faced): You have a Flask application and you want to migrate it to FastAPI. You have two options:

1. Rewrite the whole application from scratch and deploy it when it's ready.
2. Use [a2wsgi] to convert your Flask application to WSGI using [a2wsgi] and then integrate (mount) it to your FastAPI application and deploy it. By the time, you can rewrite your application step by step.
